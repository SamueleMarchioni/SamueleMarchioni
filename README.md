## Hi there 🙋🏻‍♂️
I'm Samuele Marchioni and I'm a student in Mathematical Engineering - Statistical Learning at Politecnico di Milano. 
Here are some insights about me... 

## My Education👨🏻‍🎓

<ul>
  <li> <b>MSc in Mathematical Engineering - Statistical learning, Politecnico di Milano</b><br>
      Main courses : Applied statistics, Machine learning, Bayesian statistics, Non parametric statistics, Numerical
      analysis for machine learning</li>
  
  <li><b>BSc in Mathematical Engineering, Politecnico di Milano</b><br>
      Main courses : Analysis, Models and methods for statistical inference, Probability, Algebra, Statistics,
      Economics and Business Organization</li>
  
</ul>  
   
## My projects🧑🏻‍💻

<ul>
  <li> <b>Heart failures and mixed effect models: quality of the hospitals and support to doctors’ decisions</b><br>
      The main goal of our project was to assess the differences between various hospitals in Lombardy while treating patients with heart diseases.
     </li>
  
  <li><b>Exploring Hospitalization Trends Over Time: A non parametric analysis using a functional approach, survival analysis and a mixed effects gam model.</b><br>
    In this project, we wish to exploit trends in the number of hospitalizations, through a functional approach, as well as, to model time to the next hospitalization and time to death as a function of
    the pregressed clinical history of the patient employing both survival analysis and semi-parametric modeling.
      </li>
  
  <li> <b>Modelling historical landslide occurrences in Hong Kong through Bayesian statistical analysis (https://github.com/robertatroilo/BS_project)</b><br>
      In this project we attempt to uncover the relationship between geostatistical covariates and the frequency of landslides in a given region, whilst also considering the influence each region exerts
      on one another due to spatial proximity.
     </li>

<li> <b>Innovate Ventures website (https://github.com/FilippoMonti99/HypermediaProject)</b><br>
      Innovate Ventures is a website that offers users the possibility to get in touch with the reality of a venture capital firm.
     </li>
</ul>

Unfortunately for the first two projects I signed a non disclosure agreement so I cannot share the results here.
